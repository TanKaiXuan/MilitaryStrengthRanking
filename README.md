### 2018 Military Strength Ranking

### Introduction

The finalized Global Firepower ranking utilized over 55 individual factors to determine a given nation's PowerIndex ("PwrIndx") score. The unique, in-house formula allows for smaller, more technologically-advanced, nations to complete with larger, though lesser-developed areas. A perfect PwrIndex score is 0.0000 which is realistically unattainable in the scope of the GFP formula.
